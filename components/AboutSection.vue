    <p>
      GymBet is an app that you can download from the iOS App Store or the
      Google Play store that will help to hold you and your friends accountable!
      The app will help you to keep your goals on track by esnuring that you
      have something to lose if you don't hold up your end of the bargain.
      Here's an example: You and three friends want to hold each other
      accountable to attend the gym at least 4 days a week. Each of you put in
      $5 to the group pot. If you succeed, you keep your money, but if not, then
      your $5 is dispursed evenly among the rest of the group.
