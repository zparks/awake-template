    <p>
      GymBet is an mobile app that'll help to hold you and your friends
      accountable! The app tracks your gym visits throughout the week to ensure
      your fitness goals are on track and you'll have something to lose if you
      don't hold up your end of the bargain, and something to gain if you do!
      <br />
      <br />
      Here's an example: You and three friends want to hold each other
      accountable to attend the gym at least 4 days a week. Each of you puts in
      $5 to the group pot. If you succeed in going to the gym 4 times that week,
      you keep your money and it stays in the pot for the next week. If someone
      fails, then their money goes to the groups' pot to be disbursed evenly!

          Of course your time at the gym will need to be verified to see who's

        <p>
          Change your group settings to fit your goals. Adjust the workout
          duration required, frequency, goal period, or the amount of money
          you're betting.
